# Securing Multivendor Clouds Part 3 - Entra Permissions Management - Microsoft Event for Partners

Welcome to the Securing Multivendor Clouds Part 3 repository. This event will be held on 23 June 2022 from 1300-1500 BST.

The third event in our series will focus on Entra Permissions Management, our CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entintlement Management) service, and we'll have a fourth event later in the summer of 2022 to cover additional topics that were not covered in this event. The product used to be known as CloudKnox.
